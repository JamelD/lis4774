### Final Presentation

#### Objectives
There are three (3) takes for the term project presentation, and all three takes are graded as an in-class activity. The first take is the dress rehearsal (on 11/23). Every team will incorporate my comments into the subsequent presentations. Each member from each team is expected to present something on the term project - both parts A & B. The challenge is that you must deliver a total of 10 slides in just 10 minutes. While the sequence of which team goes first, second etc will be randomized and announced in class. Class participation and active listening will be important - asking intelligent questions will benefit you. 

#### Tasks
The content of the term project presentation will include the following components:
- Title slide with your team's project title, team's name and all members' name (1 slide)
- Agenda/Outline (1 slide)
- Significance of the term project plus the literature review (2 slides): research problem, threat vector, cyber attacks, and possible countermeasures from the literature
- Research environment (1 slide): network topology illustration of your team's research environment in relations with other teams in the SECNET vLab
- Study framework (2 slides): discussing about your project Parts A & B - with screenshots and illustration: What problem you experienced and simulated?
- Your team's analysis and solutions and recommendations per problems as illustrated in Parts A and B (2 slides)
- Lesson learned, conclusions and future work (1 slide).

Please work to condense your information (less is more!) and engineer your presentation to cover every point listed above. You should pack information into each slide, and limit your presentation to 10 slides ONLY.
