### Term Project

#### Objectives 
You are required to produce a term project, building upon and complementing the material covered in class. Your term project is the composite results of your term project parts A and B but with in-depth study and discussion. The midterm paper describes your Part A, and your final paper describes both Parts A+B. You will be working with your group members as part of a team. Teams are formed during the first day of the class, in plenty of time for you to meet, plan, and work with other members of your team. Some class time may be set aside for team meetings. Projects must culminate with both a group presentation for the class, and the submission of a group final paper. 

#### Tasks
The following format and flow is suggested. You don't have to follow it exactly. Some sections may not be needed, or additional sections may be necessary. A template for this technical paper is given in this assignment folder. Please adopt the template for your paper submission. In all cases, please type and paginate your paper!
